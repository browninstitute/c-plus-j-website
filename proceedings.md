# Conference Proceedings

Computation+Journalism 2022 featured a "refereed paper" track. This consisted of three sessions, each with three papers. We collected the papers here as an informal proceedings. Authors whose names are in boldface presented the paper at C+J 2022, black meaning they were in-person and blue meaning online.

A complete schedule with abstracts can be found [here](https://github.com/browninstitute/c-plus-j-website/raw/main/docs/program.pdf).
