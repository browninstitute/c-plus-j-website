# Conference Proceedings

Computation+Journalism 2022 featured a "refereed paper" track. This consisted of three sessions, each with three papers. We collected the papers here as an informal proceedings. Authors whose names are in boldface presented the paper at C+J 2022, black meaning they were in-person and blue meaning online.

A complete schedule with abstracts can be found [here](https://github.com/browninstitute/c-plus-j-website/raw/main/docs/program.pdf).

| Applications of Machine Learning | <ol><li>Generating a Pairwise Dataset for Click-through Rate Prediction of News Articles Considering Positions and Contents \[[Paper](http://cj2022.brown.columbia.edu/proceedings/Session2Group1.pdf)\] -  **Shotaro Ishihara** (Nikkei, Inc.) and Yasufumi Nakama<p>In online news websites, the headlines and thumbnail images of articles are displayed in a list, and they are important navigation links to individual article pages. If we can predict the click-through rate (CTR) of readers to the article pages, we can assist the editors in creating article headlines and setting thumbnail images. However, the CTR that can be observed in the access log is heavily affected by the display position, and it is difficult to predict the CTR by machine learning using data on single articles. This paper proposes a method to construct a pairwise dataset based on the information such as similarity of the display positions and contents, and create a model to predict the CTR in the framework of pairwise learning-to-rank. In the experiment, we verified the usefulness of the proposed method by using the actual access log data and discuss the potential of the practical use of the CTR prediction as editing support.</p><li>Detecting Stance of Tweets Toward Truthfulness of Factual Claims \[[Paper](http://cj2022.brown.columbia.edu/proceedings/Session2Group2.pdf)\] - <span class="remote">Zhengyuan Zhu</span>, Zeyu Zhang, Foram Patel and **Chengkai Li** (University of Texas at Arlington)<li>What’s the Fairest of Them All?
