<h2>2022 Computation + Journalism Conference</h2>
<p>Data Journalism in an Expanded Field</p>
<p><strong>June 9-11, 2022</strong></p>
<p>Hosted by the <a href="https://brown.columbia.edu/">Brown Institute for Media Innovation
at Columbia Journalism School</a></p>
<h3>About the Conference</h3>
<p>News outlets rely on computation to tell some of the biggest stories of our time. They collect data when official sources have not. They build statistical models to uncover disparities, previously ignored. And they craft visualizations to reveal new dimensions to a story. Some newsrooms have expertise in-house to produce this work, while others depend on collaborations with outside researchers.</p>
<p>The Computation+Journalism Conference (C+J) is a venue where journalists and researchers meet. In this setting, news organizations can share experiences with computational and social scientists, exploring new research or “innovations in practice” that can serve the public good. At C+J we strive for symmetry in our talks and panels — journalism’s reporting conventions can be both solutions to computational problems as well as sources of new research questions.</p>
<p>Success for our conference is measured in new published stories, new kinds of research, and new cross-professional collaborations.</p>

<li>Submission deadline: <strong>May 9</strong></li>
<li>Decisions on contributed and refereed talks: <strong>May 13</strong></li>
<li>Conference dates: <strong>June 9 (half day), 10 (full day), and possibly 11 (half day)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Call for Participation</h3>
<p>We will borrow from the organizational structure used by the Joint Statistical Meetings led by the American Statistical Association. People can participate in one of several ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Propose a contributed talk with an abstract of at most 250 words. These separate talks will be divided into sessions by the Program Committee and run in parallel at the event.</li>
<li>Propose a contributed workshop with an abstract of at most 250 words. These are training sessions led by journalists or researchers, introducing a topic of interest to the community.</li>
<li>Propose a refereed talk with a two-page abstract. These talks will also be divided into sessions but will be given a special place in the program.</li>
<li>The Program Committee will organize several invited sessions.</li>
<li>The Program Committee will invite a slate of keynote speakers.</li>
</ul>
<p>More information, including how to propose and register, coming soon!</p>
