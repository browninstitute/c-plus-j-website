## Propose

We will borrow from the organizational structure used by the Joint Statistical Meetings led by the American Statistical Association. People can participate in one of several ways.

* Propose a contributed talk with an abstract of at most 250 words. These separate talks will be divided into sessions by the Program Committee and run in parallel at the event.
* Propose a contributed workshop with an abstract of at most 250 words. These are training sessions led by journalists or researchers, introducing a topic of interest to the community.
* Propose a refereed talk with a two-page abstract. These talks will also be divided into sessions but will be given a special place in the program.
* The Program Committee will organize several invited sessions.
* The Program Committee will invite a slate of keynote speakers.

More information, including where to submit proposals, coming soon!
